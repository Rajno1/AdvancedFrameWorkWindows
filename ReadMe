This is an Advanced TestNG Hybrid Frame Work developed with the help of Maven with ExtentReport.

In FrameWork structure
* We have created 'Extent-test-output' folder as a destination, for all extent reports generated.
* Under 'src/main/java' we have all the packages created that helps our test creation and execution.
    > Under 'com.issi.annotations' package we have "FrameWorkAnnotation" class, where we have our custom
      annotation that, helps to define required annotation elements to our test methods
    > We have declared all constant values that we are using in this project and their corresponding methods
      in "FrameWorkConstants" class under 'com.issi.constants' package.
    > Under 'com.issi.driver' pack we "Driver" and "DriverManger" classes to handle driver (browser) tasks.
    > Next we have created 'enum' package with constant values and to make use of these values as a selection option,
      while working.
    > Next we have 'exceptions' package , where we have created some custom exception handling methods
    > We have created one 'factories' pack to have all wait types, that we perform on specific elements at one place.
    > Next we have 'listeners' pack, that contains different listeners type.
    > In 'pages' pack we are creating individual classes for pages that are present in our application.
      and in this classes we are identifying the elements of that page and creating action methods for it.
    > Under 'reports' pack we have the complete code that related to Extent Report generation and handling.
    > And we have all utility classes under 'utils' package.
* Under 'src/main/resources' we have extent report configuration file, that helps to customise our extent report.
* In 'src/test/java' we have 'com.issi.test' pack, which contains all out test executables (classes)
* Under 'src/test/resources' we have
    > 'config folder' - with property file
    > 'DriverExecutables' - It contains all 'Drivers' that are related to chrome,firefox & ie.
